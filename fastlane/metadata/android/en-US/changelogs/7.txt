Added:
- "Send sats" system text selection action
- An introduction explaining how to use the app
- Ability to paste an address into the app either from the intro screen or using the launcher icon shortcut

Changed:
- When an invoice is accidentally opened with the app instead of an address, the app now forwards it to your wallet(s) rather than just showing an error message
